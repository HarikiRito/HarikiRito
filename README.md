# Hi, I'm Hau (aka Hariki) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making programs, solving problems, and learning new things. I usually make autonomous apps that help my life more comfortably. Some technologies I enjoy working with are Typescript, React, and MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS). I am also having an interest in Mobile Development using React Native and Flutter.

Currently working with Golang and Flutter. Try to learn some mobile native language like Kotlin or Swift.
